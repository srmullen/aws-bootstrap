Notes
=====

- In package.json scripts, why is the path to the binary being specified rather than called by npm?
- Logs go outside the application structure otherwise they would be deleted on every deploy.
- CloudFormation calls the collection of resources that are managed together as 'stack'.
- CloudFormation has parameter, resource, and outputs.
